<CENTER><b><u><i> What is a bull market?<br></i></u></b></CENTER>
<br>A bull market occurs when the prices of assets in a financial market increase substantially over an extended period of time. There are no formal criteria for a bull market, but the most common definition is a period when investment prices rise by at least 20% following two prior distinct periods when prices declined by 20% each. 
Bull markets can be driven by several factors.<br> They typically occur at times when other major macroeconomic variables are also trending up, such as corporate earnings, gross domestic profit, and consumer spending. Bull markets are also spurred by investor confidence. Optimism in a market can self-perpetuate, as investors push in more capital and drive prices higher.<br> Because of this increased demand, a bull market often leads to higher trading volumes and additional liquidity opportunities for sellers.

<br><b><u><i><CENTER>What is a bear market?<br></CENTER></i></u></b>
A bear market occurs when the prices of assets in a financial market decrease substantially over an extended period of time. The typical threshold for a bear market is a decline of 20% or more from recent highs, although the term doesnâ€™t have a universal definition.
A bearish market is often brought on by major macroeconomic and geopolitical shifts.<br> They also typically follow bull markets, when prices for assets are high relative to historical levels. <br>For example, the bear market that emerged in the U.S. in 2022 was commonly attributed to some combination of inflation, rising interest rates, falling consumer spending, and war in Ukraine. It also followed a 2021 bull market that saw the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average climb to all-time highs.

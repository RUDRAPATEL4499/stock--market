Financial markets can be divided into different subtypes:

For the assets transferred
Money market : It is traded with money or financial assets with short-term maturity and high liquidity, generally assets with a term of less than one year.
<br>Capital market : Financial assets with medium and long-term maturity are traded, which are basic for carrying out certain investment processes.
Depending on its structure
Organized market
Non-organized markets denominated in English (" Over The Counter ").
According to the negotiation phase of financial assets
<br>Primary market : Financial assets are created. In this market, assets are transmitted directly by their issuer.
Secondary market : Only existing financial assets are exchanged, which were issued at a previous time. This market allows holders of financial assets to sell instruments that were already issued in the primary market (or that had already been transmitted in the secondary market) and that are in their possession, or to buy other financial assets.
According to the geographical perspective</p><p>
National markets. The currency in which the financial assets are denominated and the residence of those involved is national.
International markets. The markets situated outside a country's geographical area.

Investment strategies<br>
Main articles: Investment strategy, Stock market prediction, and Investment management
Many strategies can be classified as either fundamental analysis or technical analysis.<br> Fundamental analysis refers to analyzing companies by their financial statements found in SEC filings, business trends, and general economic conditions. Technical analysis studies price actions in markets through the use of charts and quantitative techniques to attempt to forecast price trends based on historical performance, regardless of the company's financial prospects. One example of a technical strategy is the Trend following method, used by John W. Henry and Ed Seykota, which uses price patterns and is also rooted in risk management and diversification.

Additionally, many choose to invest via passive index funds. In this method, one holds a portfolio of the entire stock market or some segment of the stock market (such as the S&P 500 Index or Wilshire 5000). The principal aim of this strategy is to maximize diversification, minimize taxes from realizing gains, and ride the general trend of the stock market to rise.

Responsible investment emphasizes and requires a long-term horizon on the basis of fundamental analysis only, avoiding hazards in the expected return of the investment.<br> Socially responsible investing is another investment preference.</p>

Taxation :
Taxation is a consideration of all investment strategies; profit from owning stocks, including dividends received, is subject to different tax rates depending on the type of security and the holding period. Most profit from stock investing is taxed via a capital gains tax. In many countries, the corporations pay taxes to the government and the shareholders once again pay taxes when they profit from owning the stock, known as "double taxation".
